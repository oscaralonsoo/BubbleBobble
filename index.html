    <h2>Our project</h2>
    <p>We're going to replicate the 1986 Bubble Bobble game arcade version developed and published by Taito as a tribute to the game. This project has been done by two catalan students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).</p>
    <h2>About the game</h2>
    <p>Bubble Bobble, the first game in the series, is a platform arcade game originally released by Taito on June 16, 1986 in Japan. Players control two twin dragons, Bub (who is green) and Bob (who is blue), who are trying to rescue their girlfriends from a world known as the Cave of Monsters.</p>
    <p>In each level, Bub and Bob must defeat the present enemies, trapping them in bubbles blown from their mouths and then popping the bubbles. The enemies then drop bonus items when they hit the ground. There are a total of 100 levels, each becoming progressively more difficult.</p>
    <p>The game was designed around two-player gameplay, so by inserting another coin, the second dragon, Bob, can be controlled.</p>
